# Bileam (data layer) 
 
Bileam is a student from the middle of Germany, with a passion for computer science, who uses the spare-time gained from postponed finals to contribute to this project. 
During times not struck by a global pandemic, he spends his time in school or rock climbing. 
 
What motivated him the most to contribute to this project is the practical application of programming, having a clear goal, and working together with smart and kind people. 
He worked on data-gathering in the data layer and code maintenance. 
To overcome encountered challenges he talked to his pet chicken or consumed caffeine. 
 
He wanted to become a fighter-pilot, but his legs were too long for the ejection seat. 
At some point in his life, Bileam aims to work for Elon Musk and live in Norway. 
He enjoys philosophy, especially late at night.
