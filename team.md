            <p>
                Richard is Senior Data Scientist for Artificial Intelligence in a company that provides data quality software. 
                Also, he is a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich, where he does foundational research in Machine Learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project he served as the project lead. 
                Technically he was responsible for the definition of the data model of the data layer and implemented respective code. 
                Additionally he consulted on the modeling of the pandemic.

        <h4 class="text-center">modeling</h4>
        <p>
        Marius is a PhD candidate in experimental quantum physics at ETH Zurich.
        His research is investigating the nature of quantum states of sound in crystals for both, fundamental insights in the behavior of quantum states as well as their utilization for novel ways of information processing.
        In the project he is working on modelling data pandemic data. The long term goal is to obtain a decision making tool that can take into account political measures when predicting pandemic evolution.

            <h4 class="text-center">data layer</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Bileam is a student from the middle of Germany, with a passion for computer science,
                    who uses the spare-time gained from postponed finals to contribute to this project.
                    During times not struck by a global pandemic, he spends his time in school or rock climbing.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    What motivated him the most to contribute to this project is the practical
                    application of programming, having a clear goal, and working together with smart
                    and kind people.
                    He worked on data-gathering in the data layer and code maintenance.
                    To overcome encountered challenges he talked to his pet chicken or consumed caffeine.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     He wanted to become a fighter-pilot, but his legs were too long for the ejection seat.
                     At some point in his life, Bileam aims to work for Elon Musk and live in Norway.
                     He enjoys philosophy, especially late at night.

            <p>
            Kilian is born in lower Bavaria. 
            He has a M.Sc in Mechanical Engineering and is about to finish his M.Sc. in Automotive Software Engineering at TU Munich. 
            He will start with a PhD about real time networking soon. 
            He came across this project by a call for help to help creating this website. 

            During his breaks he loves juggling and slacklining.
