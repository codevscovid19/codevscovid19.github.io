Corona Spread: Data Layer and Modelling

Build a unified gold standard database of corona spread at county level and across time and use it to model the spread both historically and forecasting future developments.

How can we help researchers, decision makers and private citizens plan for the future?

We take some data, load it into python and b√§m the virus is gone!
Or, more seriously, we collect data about the pandemic, make it accesibly to researchers and communicate it to decision makers and private citizens.
